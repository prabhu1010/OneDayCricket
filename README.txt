It is difficult to find a cricketing program that more or less simulates the "game of glorious uncertainties" as it happens, which is why this program was written. The Monte Carlo simulation technique was followed and the results are more or less in sync with what one expects from a real game.

Suggestions and criticism are welcome at prabhuabc123@yahoo.com. Do not email the homenetmail address that appears at the end of the program, that mail provider went kaput a few years ago.

RUNNING THE SIMULATOR:
---------------------
1. Run the executable file odi-cricket.exe(Tampering with the data files containing the team composition is not recommended, unless you know what you are doing).
2. Match results will be stored if necessary in the same folder. Don't bother about renaming existing files, the program automatically stores results with unique filenames.
